        <h2>Timeline</h2>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>1844 - Nietzsche was born.</li>

          <li>1849 - Nietzsche lost his father to a brain ailment.</li>

          <li>1858 - 1864 Attended Schulpforta in Naumburg. Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and French—so as to be able to read important primary sources; and followed his interests in music and literature, during his summers in Naumburg.</li>

          <li>1864 - He graduated and began studying theology and classical philology at the University of Bonn in hopes of becoming a minister.</li>

          <li>1865 - Nietzsche lost his faith and wrote to his sister Elisabeth, who was deeply religious, a letter regarding his loss of faith. This letter contains the following statement: “Hence the ways of men part: if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure, then believe; if you wish to be a devotee of truth, then inquire….”</li>

          <li>1865-1866 - started to thoroughly study the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Kant, Friedrich Albert Lange and more.</li>

          <li>1867 - Nietzsche signed up for one year of voluntary service with the Prussian artillery division in Naumburg.</li>

          <li>1868 - Nietzsche was injured, leaving him and consequently turned his attention back to his studies again, completing them in 1868. Also met Richard Wagner for the first time.</li>

          <li>1869 - Nietzsche became a professor of classical philology at the University of Basel in Switzerland at the age of 24 years old without completing his doctorate or receiving a teaching certificate. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Leipzig University in March 1869, with Ritschl's support.</li>

          <li>1870–1871 - Nietzsche served as a medical orderly in the Prussian forces during the Franco-Prussian War.</li>

          <li>1872 - Nietzsche published his first book, The Birth of Tragedy.</li>

          <li>1878 - Nietzsche published Human, All Too Human (a book of aphorisms ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion).</li>

          <li>1879 - After a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. With the help of his pension and friends, Nietzsche traveled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities.</li>

          <li>1882 - Nietzsche published the first part of The Gay Science.</li>

          <li>1883 - Nietzsche tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the University of Leipzig. It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university.</li>

          <li>1886 - Nietzsche broke with his publisher Ernst Schmeitzner, disgusted by his antisemitic opinions. He then printed Beyond Good and Evil at his own expense. His sister Elisabeth married the antisemite Bernhard Förster and travelled to Paraguay to found Nueva Germania, a "Germanic" colony—a plan Nietzsche responded to with mocking laughter.</li>

          <li>1887 - Nietzsche wrote the polemic On the Genealogy of Morality.</li>

          <li>1889 - Nietzsche suffered a mental breakdown. Two policemen approached him after he caused a public disturbance in the streets of Turin. What happened remains unknown, but an often-repeated tale from shortly after his death states that Nietzsche witnessed the flogging of a horse at the other end of the Piazza Carlo Alberto, ran to the horse, threw his arms around its neck to protect it, then collapsed to the ground.</li>

          <li>1893 - Nietzsche's sister Elisabeth returned from Nueva Germania in Paraguay following the suicide of her husband. She studied Nietzsche's works and, piece by piece, took control of their publication.</li>

          <li>1898 and 1899 - Nietzsche suffered at least two strokes. They partially paralyzed him, leaving him unable to speak or walk. Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as tertiary syphilis, in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time.</li>

          <li>1900 - Nietzsche contracted pneumonia, he had another stroke during the night of 24–25 August and died at about noon on 25 August.</li>

      <div id="philosophy">
        <h2>Nietzsche's Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Perspectivism is the view point that explains the constatnt reassessment of rules according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. Nietzsche rejected objective reality and argued that knowledge is realtive to various fluid perspectives or interests.</p><br>
        <p>In his books, Beyond Good and Evil and On the Genealogy of Morality, Nietzsche gave a genealogical account of the development of modern moral systems. Nietzsche presented the shift in morals from "good and bad" toward "good and evil." He presents the conscept of "Ressentiment" to "Slave Morality" and its contrast to "Master Morality" and the Nihilism.</p><br>
        <p>The "Eternal Return" or "Eternal Recurrence" is a hypothetical concept developed by Nietzsche. Nietzsche challenges his reader to imagine there is no supernatural reincarnation but the universe is recurring infinite number of times across infinite time and space. The recurrence assumes that nothing changes and everything repeats the same was ad infinitum. Nietzsche considered this to be the heaviest burden imaginable and the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life. Nietzsche challenges his reader to contemplate that an individual's ability to not only come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires 'amor fati' - love of fate. </p>
